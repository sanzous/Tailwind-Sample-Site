# Tailwind Site
This project was to solidify my understanding of the CSS framework Tailwind. I was able to use the Tailwind documentation to create this website that can be used as a template for any business needing a simple site made.

# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, Tailwind CSS, Javascript

The project was a fun one to do as Tailwind allowed for more customizable css unlike Bootstrap. Tailwind CSS allowed for easy implementation of CSS styling by using only class names which allowed for the project to be done much faster while still providing responsive clean styles that can be customized to any need.

# Optimizations
Add the other pages to the site to make it complete. Improve transformation and transition of mobile menu.

# Lessons Learned:
This Project allowed my Tailwind CSS fundamentals to be solidifed. I learned that while Tailwind CSS is a powerful tool for quick CSS styling it also can clutter the HTML with too many class types and can be quite confusing in the long run or to other developers looking at the code.
